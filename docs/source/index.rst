Welcome to SCALT's documentation!
=============================================

**SCALT** provides a collection of python utilities that can be used to:

1. **classify** individual cells from single cell RNA seq experiments at **single cell** resolution level taking the advantage of a **maximum likelihood-based** approach and a collection of pre-compiled cell type specific lists of genes constructed by extensive re-analysis of comprehensive and expert curated catalogues; 
2. build cell type specific **lists of genes** starting from a **count matrix** and the correspoding **annotation** for each cell in a **deterministic** fashion;
3. build cell type specific **lists of genes** starting from a **count matrix** and a a gathering of **user-defined** cell type specific lists of genes making the use of an **hypergeometric** test.


If you find any issue with the software, please contact `me <mailto:daniele.traversa@unimi.it>`_, or report it  on `github <https://github.com/danitrave/CapitalCitiesGame/issues>`_.
