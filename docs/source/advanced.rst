Advanced utilities
==================

SCALT presents other utilities behyond single cell classification:

1. the tool makes use of a scRNA seq read counts matrix and the corresponding cells annotation to build series of equally-sized cell type specific lists of genes, one per each cell type present in the annotation, in a deterministic fashion. This method is free of any human interpretation bias and relies on the ground concept on which SCALT is build which is that *each cell type has its own probability of expressing a gene*;
