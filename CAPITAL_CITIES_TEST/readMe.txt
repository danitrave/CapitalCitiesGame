This folder contains two files which are aimed to represent a game. This is a simple test in which one is asked to correctly find the capital city of 10 random states. The two files must be provided together since the file "elenco_stati_capitali.py" reports the states and associated capital cities. 
This file is imported by the script "capitalCities_game.py". The latter is responsible of doing all the different steps of the game:
-insert the number of players
-give 10 random questions to each player and collect the answers
-evaluate the answers and collect the score per each player
-report the winner of the game with the associated score
-reports the wrong answers and the corrections per each player
-final results will be put in a "preliminary table"
